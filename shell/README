Note: I studied code from www.csl.mtu.edu and wikipedia for this project.

Functions:

main{
  The main of my shell reads in input from the command line and calls functions according to the input.
}

sys_exit{
  This function simply calls exit(EXIT_SUCCESS).
}

sys_execute{
  Function forks;
  Child process executes command and then exits;
  Parent process waits for child
}
