Lottery:
I got lottery scheduler to work!

Round Robin:
I've been having trouble getting files from Minix to my host computer so I wasn't able to inclue my changes to main.c and dmp_kernel.c. I didn't get round robin working anyway and you helped me edit those files for round robin, so I guess it's not that big of a deal. I named all of my round robin files *_rr so you could tell the difference.
